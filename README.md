Returning back to strings, we dig more into the code we can write to make changes to our strings inside of functions. 

**Here are some examples of what we did and what they do**

- str.toUpperCase(): Capitalizes letters.
- str.charAt(str.length -1): Gets the last character.
- str[0] + '.' + str[str.indexOf(' ')] + 1] + '.': This will make initials from a name.

## Node/Nodemon

This is a handy tool that you can use to test your code in JS, just make sure you are passing in arguments. To use this tool you simply type in *nodemon main.js* or *node main.js*. Using the second example you will have to manually put node main.js in the terminal each test you want to do.

## Booleans

Finishing up the last couple days of the week we started getting into Booleans. So what is a Boolean???

A *Boolean* is a datatype that returns either of two values i.e. true or false. In JavaScript, boolean is used as a function to get the value of a variable, object, conditions, expressions etc. in terms of true or false.

Here are some examples that can be used. These are called comparison signs.

- **==**: Both sides are equal.
- **>**: Greater than.
- **<**: Less than.
- **>=**: Greater than or equal to.
- **<**: Less than or equal to.
- **!=**: Both sides not equal.

Using the '!' operator in before your statement will reverse the boolean.

There are two operators you can use '&&' and '||'. When applied to boolean values the && operator returns true when both of its operands are true. The || operator returns false when both its operands are false.

Here is a list example of these operators.

// Logical AND operation
true  && true;  // true
true  && false; // false
false && true;  // false
false && false; // false

// Logical OR operation
true  || true;  // true
true  || false; // true
false || true;  // true
false || false; // false
